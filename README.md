## Features
### Automated Units
Units move autonomously in the battlefield. The player can only issue macro orders through toggling offensive/defensive stances.
### Tactical Battlefield
Not all fronts are the same. Fronts have different Combat Width which determines how many units can be in it at once. Use the battlefield to your advantage and gain the upper hand.
### Industrial Planning
Place Industry Blocks on the Industry Grid to activate them. Industry Blocks give a production boost to other Blocks around it. Strategically plan your industry around the priorities of the types of goods.
